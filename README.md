## Future Enhancements and Trade-offs

### Future Enhancements
- **User Accounts and Watchlist**: Add user accounts with authentication, allowing users to create and save a watchlist or mark favorite movies.
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Implement a recommendation system that tailors movie suggestions based on user search and watch history.
- **Enhanced Search Filters**: Introduce additional filters, such as rating, release date, and genre, to give users more control over search results.
- **Responsive Design**: Further optimize responsiveness for tablet and larger screens to improve the browsing experience across all devices.
- **Improved Performance**: Consider server-side rendering or caching strategies to reduce load times and manage API requests more effectively.

### Trade-offs
- **Static Generation vs. Server-side Rendering**: To prioritize performance, static generation was used over server-side rendering for category pages, sacrificing real-time updates for faster load speeds.
- **Basic Authentication**: Authentication was omitted to keep the prototype simple, but adding OAuth or third-party login support could improve security in future updates.
- **Limited State Management**: State management is currently handled with basic hooks, which keeps the codebase simple. As the app scales, a more robust solution like Redux may be needed.
